# Mythos web page

The Mythos web page contains information about some of the most important figures in the Greek Pantheon: The Twelve Olympics. It was created with the purpose of being a little index, which people can use to find facts about mythological deities!

The technologies used for the making of this project are: HTML, CSS and Framework.

As the project grows, I expect to add more information and make the user experience more intuitive and visually appealing. As this is my first project I am very excited for how its developing and I will continue to learn more in order for the webpage grow to become its best self.
